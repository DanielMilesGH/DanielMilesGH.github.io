We are currently in a climate crisis, and it is affecting countless lives across the planet, and causing irreparable damage. 

This blog is directed towards those who believe in climate change and its dangers, but believe it to be an issue in a year, two years, ten years, and don't realize how bad it currently is. The vast majority of internet users come from well off countries, and it may be hard to see the changes that have already taken place due to climate change.

Since 1979, average temperatures in the contiguous United States have risen 0.31 to 0.54 degrees Farenheit per decade, as well as eight of the top ten warmest years on record in the contiguous United States occured since 1998, according to the EPA.¹ While this is a large temperature increase, the slow nature of it means that it can be hard to actually realize that this is happening. 

Other nations have not been so lucky. The Middle East and Nortern Africa (MENA) is one of the most vunerable regions in the world to climate change, and feeling its full effects now, despite contributing only 8.7% of global greenhouse emisions, as of 2020.² Water scarcity is a huge problem, and quickly getting worse. Turkey is weaponizing water supply, cutting 60% of water going to Iraq, which also resulted in food and water shortags in Syria. Iran's upstream dams are rapidly shrinking the main water supply for Iraq's Diyala province, which has lost 70% of its water. Climate change is causing record high temperatures, record low rainfall, and desertification of the region, which is only making it worse. More than 12 million people in Iraq and Syria are losing access to water, food, and electricity because of this.³ The cost of water in Jordan has increased by 30% due to diminishing groundwater. 

These wartorn nations are feeling the largest effect, but this can cause a domino effect to the wealthier nations, if the climate crisis continues to worsen. The UN Security Council has warned that climate change is increases risk of conflict in the MENA region, causing hundreds of millions of people to be displaced within their nations. This weakens infrastructure as the big cities cannot handle millions of refugees, as well as creating ungoverned spaces in which extremist armed groups and criminal organisations thrive.

The UAE water consumption per capita is 82% higher than the world average, using water for cosmetics like lush grass, instead of using only what is needed to feed the population.
