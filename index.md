We are currently in a climate crisis, and it is affecting countless lives across the planet, and causing irreparable damage. 

This blog is directed towards those who believe in climate change and its dangers, but believe it to be an issue in a year, two years, ten years, and don't realize how bad it currently is. The vast majority of internet users come from well off countries, and it may be hard to see the changes that have already taken place due to climate change.

Since 1979, average temperatures in the contiguous United States have risen 0.31 to 0.54 degrees Farenheit per decade, as well as eight of the top ten warmest years on record in the contiguous United States occured since 1998, according to the EPA.¹ While this is a large temperature increase, the slow nature of it means that it can be hard to actually realize that this is happening. 

Other nations have not been so lucky. The Middle East and Nortern Africa (MENA) is one of the most vunerable regions in the world to climate change, and feeling its full effects now, despite contributing only 8.7% of global greenhouse emisions, as of 2020.² Water scarcity is a huge problem, and quickly getting worse. Turkey is weaponizing water supply, cutting 60% of water going to Iraq, which also resulted in food and water shortags in Syria. Iran's upstream dams are rapidly shrinking the main water supply for Iraq's Diyala province, which has lost 70% of its water. Climate change is causing record high temperatures, record low rainfall, and desertification of the region, which is only making it worse. More than 12 million people in Iraq and Syria are losing access to water, food, and electricity because of this.³ The cost of water in Jordan has increased by 30% due to diminishing groundwater. 

These wartorn nations are feeling the largest effect, but this can cause a domino effect to the wealthier nations, if the climate crisis continues to worsen. The UN Security Council has warned that climate change is increases risk of conflict in the MENA region, causing hundreds of millions of people to be displaced within their nations. This weakens infrastructure as the big cities cannot handle millions of refugees, as well as creating ungoverned spaces in which extremist armed groups and criminal organisations thrive.

The UAE water consumption per capita is 82% higher than the world average, using water for cosmetics like lush grass, instead of using only what is needed to feed the population, according to Mohammed Mohammed Saleh, Director-General of the Federal Electricity and Water Authority (Fewa). Because they share the same water sources as other nations in MENA, by doing this they are causing great harm in the developing nations near them, causing millions of people to live without knowing if they will have water.


This lack of water is also extremely costly for these developing nations that are less able to afford drastic costs. According to a World Bank Development report on the MENA region, "inadequate water supply and sanitation costs the region some $21 billion per year in economic losses. Mortality due to unsafe water supply and sanitation in a few countries in the MENA , escpecially those affected by conflict, is greater than global averages. Inadequate water supply and sanitation cost about 1 percent of regional GDP anually, with conflift-affected countries losing as much as 2-4 percent anually, shown in the following image:⁵

This lack of water supply is also only getting worse as climate change worsens, as this iamge shows that forcasted surface water stress under a RCP 8.5 "high emission scenario", which is what will happen if no large changes to stop the climate crisis is made. The left shows how much water level stress is caused by socioeconomic change, and the right shows how much it will change due to climate change. Socioeconomic change is greatly affected by climate change, so they are not independent of eachother. From this graph, we can see that countries with already high water stress level are going to skyrocket up to dangerously high levels, with only two countries seeing a decrease. Water stress is defined as the amount of water being used compared to realistically how much water there is, so this shows that if high emissions continue, the already extremely low amount of water will drastically decrease.

It isn't all bleak, however. All of this data comes from high emissions forecasts, meaning that if we make change to greatly stop our high fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions, we will be able to stop this crisis, and billions of people will be better off. Groundwater is also relatively unaffected by climate change, as being buried under the Earth protects it from high heat and droughts. According to the UN World Water Development Report, "groundwater is central to the fight against poverty, to food and water security, to the creation of decent jobs, to socioecobomic development, and to increase the resilience of societies and economies to climate change.  Reliance on groundwater will only increase, mainly due to growing water demand by all sectors combined with increasing variation in rainfall patterns.)"⁶. The graph showing surface water stress leaves out ground water, so there is still hope for having adequate water supply, at least in the short term. 

What we can do to help is to spread awareness of this issue, as many do not understand just how bad the climate crisis is for millions of people, and we need to increase funding for research and development of groundwater treatment systems so it can be better used to stop water scarcity in the MENA region, which California is currently working on but they do not have enough funding.⁷

I hope that this blog post has made some of you more aware of just how bad this issue is, and hopefully made you willing to start having more urgency in your combatting of climate change. Before making this, I also thought that climate change is going to be an issue in 20 years, or at the minimum 10 years, and that we can be slow in our response. Reading these reports have shown me that we cannot afford to act slowly, however, and that the best time to act with urgency against climate change was yesterday, but the next best time to start combatting with urgency is now.
